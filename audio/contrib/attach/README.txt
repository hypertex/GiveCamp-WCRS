ABOUT
This module provides additional CCK formaters for nodereference fields giving
you a way to attach groups of audio nodes to nodes of any content type.
Once attached, you may re-order the attachments and/or detach certain files.

INSTALLATION
After enabling the Audio, CCK and Node Reference Modules, enable Audio Attach.

You can now add a new node reference field and use "Attached audio" as the 
display type.

USAGE
Create or edit a content type that has audio attachments enabled and you will
see a field for attaching audio files. Here you will see previously attached
files and you can re-order or remove them (this does not delete them from the
site). You can either select an existing audio file to attach, or upload a new
audio file.  Please note that uploading an audio file will create a new audio
content type for that file.
