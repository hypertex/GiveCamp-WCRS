README
------

This is a simple module that allows a user to create a new audio node type. An
audio node lets you upload, stream, and download audio files, and uses the
getID3 library to read and write ID3 tag information from the audio file.

This module comes with handy Flash players that can be embedded in your site.
Some Flash players can be themed by overriding theming functions provided by
this module. Consult http://drupal.org/node/34043 for more information.
